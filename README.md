# 📂 Open Source Program Proposals

Welcome to my repository of proposals for various open source programs like **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)**, **LFX Mentorship**, **Outreachy**, and more.

This repo is a collection of the hard work, planning, and research I’ve done while applying to these programs. Each proposal reflects a deep dive into an open-source project, identifying meaningful contributions, and laying out a technical roadmap to bring real improvements to the project.
