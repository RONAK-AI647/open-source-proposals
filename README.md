✅ Why You Should Push Your Proposals to GitHub
Showcase Your Work Publicly
Your proposals reflect real research, planning, and technical understanding. Publishing them can serve as a portfolio of your writing, thinking, and problem-solving.

Track Your Progress Over Time
Keeping proposals in a GitHub repository lets you version them, refer to old drafts, and see how your thinking and skills have evolved.

Backup for Safety
GitHub acts as a cloud-based backup of your work — no worries about losing files locally.

Credibility with Future Applications
When you apply to future programs, internships, or even jobs, you can link to this repo. It demonstrates consistent effort and technical initiative.

Helps Others
Just like you might have learned from other people's proposals, someone else might benefit from your structure or ideas — especially if the proposals are well-documented.
